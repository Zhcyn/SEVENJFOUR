This was an assigned project to create a mobile application that allowed a user to record activities table view-display a formatted table that has all of the recorded activities on it. From this table you are able to delete and edit the table as you see fit activity view-this view allows a user to enter information about an activity includes: activity description start time end time setting view-allows and user to change button, font, and background color of both the table view and the activity view. This view also allows for mass deletion of all the activities recorded The current application is still under development, and the current stage only needs to test the completeness of the project and the logical correctness of the added functions. If you encounter problems during the test, please contact me.
